# Chapter 3 Linear systems of first order differential and difference equations

In this Chapter we wish to deploy the techniques learnt in the previous chapters to solve systems of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and systems of linear difference equations. We shall also see a number of applications of these methods.
