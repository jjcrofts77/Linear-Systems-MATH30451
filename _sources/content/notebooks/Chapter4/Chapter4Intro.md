# Chapter 4 Controllability, observability and stability

In this chapter we learn about the important related topics of control theory, stability and feedback. Our focus will be on linear systems of either ODEs or difference equations. The techniques learnt here are fundamental to many areas of science including systems biology, quantum computing and optics to name a few.
