# Chapter 1 Introduction

This course will provide standard results and techniques for solving systems of linear autonomous differential and 
difference equations, including Laplace transform and matrix methods. Based on this material an introduction to the 
ideas of mathematical control theory will be given, with emphasis on stability and feedback.
