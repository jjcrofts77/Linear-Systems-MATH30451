There are three main cases, some of which split up into sub cases, but all  follow the same general method: (i) three distinct eigenvalues, (ii) two distinct eigenvalues, i.e., the characteristic equation has one repeated root, and one other root, (iii) one eigenvalue, i.e., the characteristic equation has one thrice repeated root.\n",
