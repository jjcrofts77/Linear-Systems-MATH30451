# Chapter 2 Introduction

Recall that if $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, and if we choose $P$ to be the matrix whose columns are the orthonormal eigenvectors of $A$, then the matrix $D=P^{-1}AP$ is diagonal, with non-zero elements given by the eigenvalues of $A$. However, if the matrix $A$ is not symmetric then diagonalisation might not be possible. For such systems, a structure, which is close to diagonal form, known as the Jordan canonical form, can be obtained.
